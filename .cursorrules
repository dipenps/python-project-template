# .cursorrules — Python Project Best Practices
# Purpose: Enforce clean, reliable, testable Python that ships.
# Scope: Applies to all Python repos in this workspace unless overridden locally.

==================================================
HIGH-LEVEL PRINCIPLES
==================================================
1. Shipping > cleverness. Prefer boring, readable solutions over "smart" one-liners.
2. Tests are non-optional. Any change touching logic must include/adjust tests.
3. Types are part of the code. Use typing and mypy; treat type errors like test failures.
4. One source of truth. Config via pydantic (or dynaconf) and env vars; no magic constants.
5. Automation everywhere. Pre-commit, CI, codegen, docs—no manual drudgery.
6. Reproducibility or it didn’t happen. Lock dependencies and pin tools; log versions and seeds.
7. Security by default. No secrets in code; minimum permissions; dependencies scanned.
8. Small PRs, crisp commits. Describe intent, not just “fix”.
9. Docs that someone can actually follow. Update README and ADRs when behavior changes.
10. Fail loudly, early, and in the right place. Rich errors with context, central logging.

==================================================
CODING STANDARDS
==================================================
- Use **Ruff** for formatting (line length 88–100), linting, and import sorting. It replaces Black, isort, and Flake8 with a single, faster tool.
- Typing: Python ≥3.11. All public APIs must be fully typed. mypy strict mode.
- Docstrings: Google/NumPy style. Explain "why", not "what".
- Errors: Raise specific exceptions. Use `raise ... from e`. Never swallow errors silently.
- Concurrency: async for I/O, multiprocessing for CPU. Don’t block the event loop.
- Logging: structlog or logging w/ JSON. No prints.

==================================================
TESTING POLICY
==================================================
- pytest only, coverage ≥85%.
- Property-based tests w/ hypothesis for core algorithms.
- Unit tests = isolated, deterministic.
- Each bug fix requires a regression test.

==================================================
DEPENDENCIES & SECURITY
==================================================
- Pin direct deps in pyproject. Commit uv.lock.
- Weekly dep audit with pip-audit.
- No secrets in code. Use env/secret managers.
- Block PRs if audit fails.

==================================================
PERFORMANCE & RELIABILITY
==================================================
- Measure before optimizing (py-spy, scalene, cProfile).
- Use timeouts/retries with jitter on all external calls.
- Avoid global caches unless justified.

==================================================
GIT & PR HYGIENE
==================================================
- Branch naming: feat/<topic>, fix/<issue>, chore/<task>.
- Commit messages: imperative mood, "why + what".
- PR size <400 LOC preferred. Must include scope, tests, rollback plan.
- Require review; keep main releasable.
- Maintain a detailed changelog (CHANGELOG.md) with all user-facing changes, grouped by type (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security). Update on every release.

==================================================
CI / CD
==================================================
- CI steps:
  1) uv sync
  2) ruff format --check .
  3) ruff check .
  4) mypy
  5) pytest --cov
  6) pip-audit
- Fail merge on errors. Publish wheels on tag.

==================================================
PRE-COMMIT
==================================================
- ruff format
- ruff check --fix
- mypy (changed files)
- detect-secrets
- pytest quick checks
- trailing-whitespace + EOF fixer

==================================================
FRAMEWORK NOTES
==================================================
FastAPI:
- Pydantic models for requests/responses.
- /healthz and /ready endpoints.
- Error handlers, request logging, correlation IDs.

Django:
- Follow MVT. ORM best practices. Migrations mandatory.

Data/ML:
- Notebooks = exploration only. Commit via jupytext.
- Seed everything. Version datasets/models.
- Document provenance, bias, and metadata.

==================================================
WHAT CURSOR SHOULD DO
==================================================
- When creating a module: scaffold file w/ docstring + typed stubs + test file.
- When fixing errors: explain cause, propose minimal fix, add regression test.
- When refactoring: preserve behavior, reduce complexity, update tests.
- When adding features: propose API, schemas, and draft tests first.
- When deps change: update pyproject + lockfile, run audit.

==================================================
PROMPT TEMPLATES
==================================================
1. Add a Feature (TDD)
"""
As a senior Python dev, implement <feature>.
Constraints:
- Modify only <modules>.
- Add tests under tests/unit/ covering <cases>.
- Keep public API typed + documented.
Deliver:
- Diff patch + test plan.
"""

2. Debug a Failure
"""
Given this traceback + code, identify root cause and smallest fix.
Add a regression test. Explain why it won’t recur.
"""

3. Refactor for Clarity
"""
Refactor <module> to reduce complexity, preserve behavior.
Targets: cyclomatic complexity <10, functions <120 lines.
Include before/after + updated tests.
"""

==================================================
NON-NEGOTIABLES
==================================================
- No `print` for logging.
- No `import *`.
- No global mutable state.
- No “TODO” without linked issue.
- No commented-out dead code.
