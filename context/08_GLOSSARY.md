# Glossary

## Terms and Definitions

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the {{ project_name }} project.

## A

### Agent
A self-contained component that can process messages, maintain state, and communicate with other agents. Agents are the fundamental building blocks of the system architecture.

### Agent Communication Protocol
The standardized format and rules for messages exchanged between agents, including message structure, types, and handling procedures.

### Agent Lifecycle
The stages an agent goes through during its operation: initialization, running, and shutdown.

### Agent Registry
A centralized registry that maintains information about all available agents, their capabilities, and current status.

### Async/Await
Python programming pattern for handling asynchronous operations, allowing non-blocking execution of I/O operations.

## B

### BaseAgent
The abstract base class that all agents must inherit from, defining the common interface and behavior.

### Business Logic
The core functionality and rules that implement the business requirements of the application.

## C

### Circuit Breaker
A design pattern that prevents cascading failures by temporarily stopping calls to a failing service.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
The text-based interface for interacting with the application through command-line commands.

### Configuration Management
The process of managing application settings, environment variables, and deployment-specific parameters.

### Correlation ID
A unique identifier used to trace requests across multiple components and services.

### Copier
A template engine tool used to generate project structures from templates with variable substitution.

## D

### Data Manifest
A document that describes the data models, schemas, and data flow within the system.

### Deployment
The process of installing and configuring the application in a target environment.

### Docker
A containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into portable containers.

## E

### End-to-End Testing
Testing that verifies the complete workflow of the application from start to finish.

### Error Handling
The mechanisms and strategies for detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors.

### Evaluation Plan
A comprehensive plan for testing, validating, and assessing the quality of the system.

## F

### Functionality
The features and capabilities that the system provides to its users.

## G

### GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub for automating software workflows.

## H

### Health Check
A mechanism for monitoring the status and availability of the application.

### Heartbeat
A periodic signal sent by agents to indicate they are alive and functioning.

## I

### Integration Testing
Testing that verifies the interaction between different components of the system.

### Input Validation
The process of checking and sanitizing user input to prevent errors and security issues.

## J

### JSON Schema
A specification for describing the structure and validation rules of JSON data.

## K

### Kubernetes
A container orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.

## L

### Load Testing
Testing the system's behavior under expected load conditions.

### Logging
The process of recording events and information about the application's operation.

## M

### Message Queue
A communication mechanism that allows agents to send and receive messages asynchronously.

### Message Type
The classification of messages based on their purpose (command, event, query, response, error, heartbeat).

### Model Manifest
A document that describes the data models, schemas, and data structures used in the system.

### mypy
A static type checker for Python that helps catch type-related errors.

## N

### Namespace
A way to organize and isolate resources in Kubernetes.

## O

### Observability
The ability to understand the internal state of a system through monitoring, logging, and tracing.

## P

### Performance Testing
Testing that measures the system's performance under various conditions.

### pytest
A testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write and run tests.

### pyproject.toml
A configuration file that defines project metadata, dependencies, and build settings.

## Q

### Quality Metrics
Measurable indicators of code quality, performance, and reliability.

## R

### Resource Limits
Constraints on the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources that an agent can use.

### Retry Policy
A strategy for automatically retrying failed operations with configurable delays and limits.

### ruff
A fast Python linter and code formatter that replaces multiple tools.

## S

### Security Testing
Testing that verifies the system's security measures and vulnerability resistance.

### Smoke Testing
Basic testing to verify that the system's core functionality works.

### Stress Testing
Testing the system's behavior under extreme load conditions.

### System Configuration
The overall configuration settings that control the behavior of the entire system.

## T

### Type Hints
Annotations in Python code that specify the expected types of variables and function parameters.

### Type Safety
The property of a programming language that prevents type-related errors at runtime.

## U

### Unit Testing
Testing individual components or functions in isolation.

### uv
A fast Python package manager and project manager.

## V

### Validation
The process of checking data against defined rules and constraints.

### Virtual Environment
An isolated Python environment that allows different projects to have different dependencies.

## W

### Workflow
A sequence of steps or processes that accomplish a specific task.

## X

### XML
Extensible Markup Language, used for structured data representation.

## Y

### YAML
YAML Ain't Markup Language, a human-readable data serialization format.

## Z

### Zero Downtime
A deployment strategy that allows updates without interrupting service availability.
